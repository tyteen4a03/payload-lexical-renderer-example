# Lexical renderer example

Adapted from [@AlessioGr](https://github.com/AlessioGr)'s work. This is an example of what you can implement to render Lexical as React nodes. You're expected to modify the example yourself and adapt this to your needs.

The `http://localhost:3000` that sometimes shows up in media is because at the time of developing this, Payload and Next were two apps, so as a quick cheat I made the media read from `http://localhost:3000` which is where Payload lived. You can get rid of this.

There's no requirement to keep the code `async`. If you want to remove all asyncs (e.g. because you want to render on the client), feel free to make the change.
